I am originally from India and came from the family of farmers. In my childhood I have spent lot of time on the farms and learned some real-life lessons on human perseverance.

I then went to study chemical engineering from IIT Kanpur and borrowed my first suit when I was twenty-one in final year of IIT for a job interview in Ansys, industry leader in Computation Fluid Dynamics. After modelling flow of liquids in high temperature, I then moved to financial sector and worked in a couple of banks in Mumbai, “the city of dreams”.

While working in JPMorgan Chase, I got interested in economics and statistics. I got eager to learn more about it and went to study masters in economics from renowned Delhi School of Economics. There the new horizon of research opened for me and I decided to pursue research.

I won a fully funded offer to do Master of Research from University of Warwick and moved to London. I secured the distinction in that research degree and progressed to a fully funded PhD program. Now, I am in the final phase of my PhD.

I like to build things whether it is piece of software, garden, or recipes. In my free time which is rare because I have a two-year-old :baby: now, I like to cook something special for my family. Here are pictures of some of them.

Thanks for stopping by and reading about me!
