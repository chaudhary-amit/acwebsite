 I am originally from India and came from a family of farmers. In my childhood I spent lot of time on farms and learned some real-life lessons about human perseverance.

I then went on to study chemical engineering at IIT Kanpur. I borrowed my first suit when I was twenty-one and in my final year at IIT for a job interview with Ansys, an industry leader in Computation Fluid Dynamics. After working at Ansys, modelling the flow of liquids at high temperatures, I then moved to the financial sector and worked in a couple of banks in Mumbai, “the city of dreams”.


While working at JPMorgan Chase, I became interested in economics and statistics. I became eager to learn more about these topics, and went to study for a master’s degree in economics from the Delhi School of Economics. There, new horizons of research opened for me and I decided to pursue a PhD.


 I won a fully funded offer to enrol in a Master’s of Research program at the University of Warwick and moved to London. I secured a distinction in that research degree and progressed to a fully funded PhD program. Now, I am in the final phase of my PhD.

I like to make things, whether it is piece of software, a garden, or a recipe. In my free time, which is rare because I have a two-year-old 👶 now, I like to cook something special for my family. Here are some pictures.

Thanks for stopping by and reading about me!
