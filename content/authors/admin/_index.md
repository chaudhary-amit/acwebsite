I am a final year PhD candidate in Economics at the University of Warwick. My research focuses on econometrics and statistics. I hold a BTech in engineering from the Indian Institute of Technology, Kanpur and a MA in economics from the Delhi school of Economics. Before starting my PhD, I have worked in finance at JPMorgan Chase and ICICI bank. 

In my research, I provide solutions to real-world problems. In this journey from idea generation to providing solutions, I use statistical and mathematical methods. My projects use large data sets that I have web scraped by writing automated programs. I have also taught courses covering econometrics, probability, statistics, and mathematics at University of Warwick.
