My research interest lies in cryptocurrencies and blockchain technologies focused on Decentralized Finance (DeFi), analyses of incentives in protocols, cryptocurrency adoption, smart contracts, and tokenomics.

I am a Research Fellow at [Gillmore Centre for Financial Technology](https://www.wbs.ac.uk/research/research-centres-and-networks/gillmore-centre-financial-technology/). Previosly I lead the research and development of DeFi protocols and spearheaded the design of blockchain economic models at [Polygon](https://polygon.technology/). I have worked in quantitative roles in traditional finance firms like [JPMorgan Chase](https://www.jpmorganchase.com/) and [ICICI bank](https://www.icicibank.com/). I started my career as a computational fluid dynamics engineer at [Ansys](https://www.ansys.com/en-gb/products/fluids/ansys-fluent).

I hold a PhD in Economics from the University of Warwick, an MA in economics from the Delhi School of Economics, and a Bachelor of Technology from IIT Kanpur.


My research shows that transparent [quantitative models](/publication/market_risk/) can be built to make the DeFi protocols financially stable. The risk assessment simulations can be used to design better DeFi protocols e.g. [liquidation](/publication/toxic_liquidations/) logic in Lending protocols. I have worked on [stablecoins](/publication/vox_stablecoin/) design. My work shows how blockchain scaling solutions make [decentralized exchanges](/publication/dex_polygon/) a viable alternative to CLOB-based centralized exchanges.  My research also explores the fundamental determinant of [interest rates](publication/compound_carry_trade/) in the cryptocurrency market. I am  working on the incentive design of a multi-chain ecosystem with exponential scaling capacity that aims to provide a decentralized internet infrastructure.
