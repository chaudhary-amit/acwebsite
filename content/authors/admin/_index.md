I am a final year PhD candidate in Economics at the University of Warwick. My research focuses on finance, econometrics and statistics. I hold a BTech in engineering from the Indian Institute of Technology, Kanpur and a MA in economics from the Delhi school of Economics. Before starting my PhD, I have worked in finance at JPMorgan Chase and ICICI bank. 

I have worked on cryptocurrency asset pricing,  FX trading using crypto derivative assets, Alpha generation using novel signals in systematic trading, market microstructure related to after-hours trading in the equities market, and peer-to-peer digital markets like Airbnb.

I am an author of R statistical package called acblm. This R package is based on my novel research method to estimate the unobserved non-linear latent factors using machine learning.

My research papers also have strong causal inference component.

I am skilled in R, Python, and data science techniques. I have also taught courses covering econometrics, probability, statistics, and mathematics at University of Warwick.
