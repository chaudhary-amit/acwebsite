I am a [honorary research fellow](https://www.wbs.ac.uk/about/person/CHAUDHARY/) at Gillmore Centre for Financial Technology at [University of Warwick](https://www.wbs.ac.uk/research/research-centres-and-networks/gillmore-centre-financial-technology/). 

I was the Head of DeFi Research at [Polygon](https://polygon.technology/). At Polygon, I also led the R&D and incubation of innovative blockchain primitives and co-authored the whitepaper of Polygon 2.0. I have authored multiple papers on the topics of zero knowledge proofs, privacy, novel design and risk assessment of DeFi protocols and crypto economics. 

I am an active advisor and speaker in the blockchain  community, and has served as a technical advisor for several blockchain startups. 
I have worked in quantitative roles in traditional finance firms like [JPMorgan Chase](https://www.jpmorganchase.com/) and [ICICI bank](https://www.icicibank.com/). I started my career as a computational fluid dynamics engineer at [Ansys](https://www.ansys.com/en-gb/products/fluids/ansys-fluent).

I hold a PhD in Economics from the University of Warwick, an MA in economics from the Delhi School of Economics, and a Bachelor of Technology from Indian Institute of Technology Kanpur.

My research interest lies in cryptocurrencies and blockchain technologies focused on Decentralized Finance (DeFi), analyses of incentives in protocols, cryptocurrency adoption, smart contracts, and tokenomics.

I am a Research Fellow at [Gillmore Centre for Financial Technology](https://www.wbs.ac.uk/research/research-centres-and-networks/gillmore-centre-financial-technology/). Previosly I lead the research and development of DeFi protocols and spearheaded the design of blockchain economic models at [Polygon](https://polygon.technology/). I have worked in quantitative roles in traditional finance firms like [JPMorgan Chase](https://www.jpmorganchase.com/) and [ICICI bank](https://www.icicibank.com/). I started my career as a computational fluid dynamics engineer at [Ansys](https://www.ansys.com/en-gb/products/fluids/ansys-fluent).

I hold a PhD in Economics from the University of Warwick, an MA in economics from the Delhi School of Economics, and a Bachelor of Technology from IIT Kanpur.


My research shows that transparent [quantitative models](/publication/market_risk/) can be built to make the DeFi protocols financially stable. The risk assessment simulations can be used to design better DeFi protocols e.g. [liquidation](/publication/toxic_liquidations/) logic in Lending protocols. I have worked on [stablecoins](/publication/vox_stablecoin/) design. My work shows how blockchain scaling solutions make [decentralized exchanges](/publication/dex_polygon/) a viable alternative to CLOB-based centralized exchanges.  My research also explores the fundamental determinant of [interest rates](publication/compound_carry_trade/) in the cryptocurrency market. I am  working on the incentive design of a multi-chain ecosystem with exponential scaling capacity that aims to provide a decentralized internet infrastructure.
