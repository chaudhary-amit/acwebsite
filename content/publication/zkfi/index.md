abstract: "We propose a middleware solution designed to facilitate seamless integration of privacy using zero-knowledge proofs within various multi-chain protocols, encompassing domains such as DeFi, gaming, social networks, DAOs, e-commerce, and the metaverse. Our design achieves two divergent goals. zkFi aims to preserve consumer privacy while achieving regulation compliance through zero-knowledge proofs. These ends are simultaneously achievable. zkFi protocol is designed to function as a plug-and-play solution, offering developers the flexibility to handle transactional assets while abstracting away the complexities associated with zero-knowledge proofs. Notably, specific expertise in zero-knowledge proofs (ZKP) is optional, attributed to zkFi's modular approach and software development kit (SDK) availability."
