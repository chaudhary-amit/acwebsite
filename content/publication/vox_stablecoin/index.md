abstract: On 10 May 2022, the price of TerraUSD, an algorithmic stablecoin operating on the Terra blockchain, fell and it lost its peg to one US dollar. Using the devaluation of the TerraUSD peg as a case study, this column shows how algorithmic stablecoins are vulnerable to speculative attacks when the system is under-collateralised. The authors point to solutions – stable collateral and over-collateralisation – to stabilise the peg.
