abstract: "Executing on decentralized exchanges (DEXs) provides a higher level of security for
clients’ funds. Clients can execute their trades directly from their own wallet, using
smart contracts, and keep custody of their assets. This higher level of security comes
at the cost of “gas fees”, which users of a blockchain have to pay to validators for
verifying transactions. In this paper, we analyze the effect of gas fees and network
speed on execution cost and liquidity distribution on the largest DEX, Uniswap v3.
Specifically, we use the entry of Polygon, a scaling solution to the incumbent Ethereum,
as an exogenous shock to gas fees reduction and speed increase. We expect that lower
gas fees and higher speed on Polygon should lead to higher concentration of liquidity
around the market price. Indeed, it becomes easier for liquidity providers to revise
their positions and re-post liquidity around the market price. Our preliminary findings
show that, whereas overall market depth on Polygon is lower compared to Ethereum,
liquidity is indeed more concentrated around the market price. This higher liquidity
concentration is especially important for execution of smaller trades. Indeed, we find
that price impact for smaller trades (up to $10K) is lower on Polygon, compared to
Ethereum."
