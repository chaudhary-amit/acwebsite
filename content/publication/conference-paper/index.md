abstract: In this paper, I ask whether the total productivity in the economy can be increased by reallocating workers. I develop an estimation methodology that allows three-sided heterogeneity in worker, manager, and firm interaction. I encapsulate the machine learning in the classification step of estimation to the Markovian model of worker mobility. I apply my model to the novel micro data of police department comprising worker level measurement of productivity to show if the current matching level is raised using optimal matching rule (positive assortative matching) then there is an 10 % increase in the aggregate productivity of police department.
