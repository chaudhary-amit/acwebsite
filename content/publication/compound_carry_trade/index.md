abstract: In this paper, we provide a model to explain equilibrium pricing of interest rates on Defi lending protocols. We pin down the fundamental sources of risk that explain the cross-section of interest rates. We also examine whether classic no arbitrage conditions in currency markets hold like covered interest rate parity. We find interest rate differences reflect the relative bearish and bullish beliefs of investors. If long positions on risky cryptocurrencies dominate, we show that interest rates are lower relative to stablecoins. We strengthen our findings by documenting the link between the interest rate differences and futures premia
