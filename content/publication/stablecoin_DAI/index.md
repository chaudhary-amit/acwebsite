abstract: The paper study the mechanisms that govern price stability of MakerDAO's DAI token, the first decentralized stable coin. DAI works through a set of autonomous smart contracts, in which users deposit cryptocurrency collateral, typically Ethereum, and borrow a fraction of their positions as DAI tokens. Using data on the universe of collateralized debt positions, we show that DAI price covaries negatively with returns to risky collateral. The peg-price volatility is related to collateral risk, while the stability rate has little ability to stabilize the coin. The introduction of safe collateral types has led to an increase in peg stability
